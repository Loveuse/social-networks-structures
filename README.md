# social-networks-structures
University project, code related to lessons and paper presentation for the class of Structures of Social Networks.

The project consists of applying different centrality measures on a read-world sample in order to evaluate the influence of the most important nodes of the social network. The goal is to find the small set of nodes that will influence the maximum amount of nodes in the network. 

The spreading model used is a variant of the Voter model and the centrality measures used are Betweeness, Eigenvector and PageRank; while the graphs used are a sample of a Twitter, random, Watts-Strogatz and Watts-Strogatz on the grid with clustering exponent of q = 2^3 graphs. 

The presentation included is based on the paper "Max Algorithms in Crowdsourcing Environments" from Petros Venetis, et. all.
